# robotic-arm-control-vlsi
This project presents the design, simulation and implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control a robotic arm using a hardware description language (HDL). The FSM is designed to handle object detection, gripping, sorting based on weight, and emergency stops. The FSM was implemented in Verilog and verified through simulation using ModelSim. The synthesized netlist was generated using Cadence Genus and the full chip layout was completed using Cadence Innovus. The system was optimized for power, area, and timing constraints to ensure efficient operation. The results confirm the successful implementation of a reliable FSM-based robotic arm controller suitable for industrial automation.
